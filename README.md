# Text_Data_Extraction_Using_BERT

This project focuses on analyzing a set of financial/legal text documents of franchise chains, 
using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and BERT to extract answers for questions. 

The main objectives include: 
- Visualizing frequently used words using word clouds. 
- Extracting key topics from the dataset using topic modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA). 
- Measuring document similarity using cosine similarity with different vectorization methods. 
- Using deep learning-based embeddings (BERT) for improved text representation. 
- Applying clustering (KMeans) to group similar documents. 
- Evaluating clustering performance using the Silhouette Score.
- Extracting answers to questions like 'What is the initial franchise fee?'
- Evaluating the extracted answers using 'Exact Match' and F1 score.

All the text files are found in the folder 'Data'
